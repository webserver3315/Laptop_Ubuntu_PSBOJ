Term detectors
====================

Lift and translate epimorphisms

- Address term (auipc)
- Constant term (lui/shift/add/sub)
- Nop (many nop encodings)
- Useless branch term (branch to next, branch to branch)
- Spin term detection (unconditional jump to self)
- Implicit Function continuation term (branch target)
- Call lift - AUIPC,JALR and JAL relaxation
- Function ABI lift - Epilog/Prolog detection
- Stack spill term (translate into SSA form)
- Rotate (sub/shift/shift/or) -,>>,<<,| -> >>>,<<<
- Predication (lift branches; many forms of predication)
- Coalescing of li,sb byte stores into large movabsq stores
- Loop induction variable detection
- Coalescing constant in register to immediate in compare and branch
- Coalescing of load or store plus addi into move base + index * scale
- Coalescing of load or store plus constant add into move base + index * scale
- Coalescing of load or store plus constant mul into move base + index * scale
