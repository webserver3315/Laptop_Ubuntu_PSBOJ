    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
    What, is Horatio there?
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
    That was and is the question of these wars.
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    But where was this?
    Then saw you not his face?
    O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    The safety and health of this whole state;
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
    What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
    'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
    What is between you? give me up the truth.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
    Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
    That he is open to incontinency;
    That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
    And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
    There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
    No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
    Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
    He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
    And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.
    I doubt it is no other but the main;
    His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    That we find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
    Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
    Came this from Hamlet to her?
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
    This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    [Pointing to his head and shoulder]
    Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
    And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
    Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a

    What is the matter, my lord?
    [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
    Indeed, that is out o' the air.
    You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
    Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
    is a strumpet. What's the news?
    Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
    that she sends you to prison hither?
    Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
    substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
    To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
    for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
    prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
    custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
    with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
    excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
    He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
    shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
    sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
    there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
    players--as it is most like, if their means are no
    Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
    'Sblood, there is something in this more than
    come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
    I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
    hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
    Then came each actor on his ass,--
    friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
    With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
    Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
    Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
    'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    That from her working all his visage wann'd,
    As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
    More relative than this: the play 's the thing
    He does confess he feels himself distracted;
    And gather by him, as he is behaved,
    If 't be the affliction of his love or no
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    To be, or not to be, that is the question,
    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
    transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
    likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
    If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
    another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
    word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
    the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
    first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
    the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
    that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
    the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
    your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
    How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    There is a play to-night before the king;
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others
    Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
    the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
    I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
    the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

    'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
    The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play

    Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
    O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
    is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's

    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,

    He's loved of the distracted multitude,

    What is the cause, Laertes,

    But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother

    And they can well on horseback: but this gallant

    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    To cut his throat i' the church.

    And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
    'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
    So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

    the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine

    So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;

    Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.

    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
    This is too heavy, let me see another.
    This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
    [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
    It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
