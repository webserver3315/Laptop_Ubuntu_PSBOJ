# Lexical Analyzer with Python3
1. (By hand) Define tokens based on the given lexical specifications
2. (By hand) Make a regular expression for each token
3. (By hand) Construct a NFA for recognizing tokens
4. (By hand) Construct a DFA transition table for recognizing tokens
5. Implement a program which lexically analyzes an input source code by using the DFA transition table
