I love you, I love you, I love you
Sorry, I never meant to
But who're we kidding, it wasn't love I had a say
One look at you and I won't have it any other way
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you to need me, too
I know that I signed up for this casually
But I fell for your tricks, I'm the casualty

Can we just reset, restart and then replay?
Take me back to when all
You wanted was to love on me everyday, yeah
I love you, I love you, I love you
Words I will never hear from you
Wishing I could turn back the hands of time
To when I feel your hands on me
And your lips on mine
