I like you, I like you, I like you
Sorry, I never meant to
But who're we kidding, it wasn't like I had a say
One look at you and I won't have it any other way
I want you, I want you, I want you
I want you to want me, too
I know that I signed up for this casually
But I fell for your tricks, I'm the casualty

Can we just reset, restart and then replay?
Take me back to when all
You wanted was to love on me everyday, yeah
I like you, I like you, I like you
Words I will never hear from you
Wishing I could turn back the hands of time
To when I feel your hands on me
And your lips on mine
